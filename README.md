MLA Citation Drag and Drop - END OF LIFE
==========================

Over the last twelve months the project team has been carrying out a complete technical review of the code used for this project. As part of the review, it has become apparent that the required investment to bring the code in line with modern standards is very substantial. **Unfortunately, the time has come to make the difficult decision to sunset this project.**

Instead, the Marquette University Raynor Memorial Libraries has decided to focus resources on developing a more robust version from the ground up that meets modern standards. [That version is also available as an open source download.](http://marquetterml.github.io/information-literacy-modules/)

The code will remain preserved here for posterity. Please feel free to continue to use and build upon the project code, however, **as of March 30th, 2018**, the Marquette University Raynor Memorial Libraries will no longer be maintaining or updating the project. 


Project Description
--------------

Code for a drag and drop exercise to teach students how to identify parts of a published work that are needed in an MLA citation. 

This was used as the opening activity for the information literacy sessions taught by librarians at Marquette University to all First Year English students. It is intended to foreshadow some of the topics covered during the session and as a qucik self assessment for students to test their knowlege of publication types and MLA citation.


Installation
